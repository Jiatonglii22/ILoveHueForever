# ILoveHueForever
Project Name: I Love HUE Forever 
Project Description: This is a puzzle game where the goal of 
    the player is to rearrange the colors back into a gradient. 
    The player will be shown cells of different shapes depending 
    on the level (level 1 is squares, level 2 is isometric, level
    3 is randomly generated polygons with voronoi algorithm). By 
    clicking on the shapes, the player can select the color and when 
    clicking another shape, the player can switch the two colors. 
    If the player is stuck, they can press 'spacebar' for a hint where
    the best hint will be generated based on the number of moves the 
    player still needs to make in order to reach a state where if they 
    switch two colors, both will end up at the correct location relative
    to the gradient. The game is over once the player rearranges all the
    colors back to the correct position in the gradient. 

How to run project: 
    Open TP.py and press run to run the project. The file will take 
    some time to run due to the voronoi algroithm. Please be patient with it. :)

Shortcuts: 
    'Up' and 'Down' arrow keys will show the next or previous level

No additional libraries needed.
